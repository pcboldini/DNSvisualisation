## Explanation

### Movie #1: Two-dimensional simulation — nonlinear forcing under pseudo-boiling conditions

This movie (Figure 9 in the manuscript) illustrates contours of density (ρ) in an *xy*-plane over one forcing period (*T₀*, the period of the fundamental wave). The pseudo-critical point at *y = y<sub>pc</sub>* lies within the green region, i.e., between 98% of max(*c<sub>p</sub>*) and max(*c<sub>p</sub>*).

### Movies #2, #3, and #4: Three-dimensional simulations — breakdown to turbulence

These movies (Figure 12 in the manuscript) show isosurfaces of the **Q-criterion**, colored by streamwise velocity magnitude, over one forcing period (*T₀*). The side *xy*-plane displays instantaneous spanwise vorticity (ω<sub>z</sub>). Separation zones (regions with *u* < 0) are shown as cyan isosurfaces in cases **Tw110-LA** and **Tw110-IA**. For clarity, the domain is repeated three times in the spanwise direction.

- **Movie #2**: Case **Tw095-LA** — Subcritical regime (*Q* = 0.015)
